# AT70.02 Project: Path Finding

Python implementation of Pathfinding algorithm using pygame.

## Description

This project is part of AIT's AT70.02 Data Strucure and Algorithm to demeonstrate two pathfinding algorithm including
- A-star Algorithm
- Dijkstra Algorithm

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

```
git clone ...
cd ...
pip isntall ...

```

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
python main.py
```

## Help

- `Left-click` to create `start`, `end`, and `barrier` (`start`, `end`, and `barrier` will be created respectively)  
- `Right-click` to remove/reset that spot  
- `SPACEBAR` to run the algorithm (`start` and `end` need to be already created.)  
- `c` to reset the whole program  
- `s` to save the current map
